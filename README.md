## Description <a id = "Description"></a>
This project servers as a command line application to automatically generate a html file to display a team with profiles for each member. The profiles include the role of each member along with some information about the member depending on thier role. 
## Installation <a id = "Installation"></a>
In order to use this command line application the user will first need to clone the the repository code onto their own machine. From there they will need to install all the dependencies included in the package.json file by running the "npm -i" in the commands line. From there they can run the index.js file in the terminal to run the program by calling the command "node index.js"
## Usage <a id = "Usage"></a>
 In the terminal the first question that will be asked is to enter the information about the team manager. Once all this information has been input by the user the user will be prompted with a choice. They can choose to add an engineer to the team, add an intern to the team or finish the team profile. If the user selects to add an enginner. They will be asked questions about the enginner mostly the same as the manager questions with the addition of a question about the enginners github. Similarly the intern is the same as the engineer expect instead of asking for a github it will ask for the school they attend. Once you finish answers the questions the user will again be prompted to add team members or finish building team. The user can add as many engineers and interns are they please and once they are dont they will select finished building team. Once they select to finish a team.html file will be created with a website built displaying all the information from the teams members that they added.
